# ðŸ“Š Option Pricing Visualizations using Black-Scholes Model

This repository showcases the implementation of **option pricing models** and their visualizations, including 3D surface plots for **European** and **Binary options**. It explores how various parameters (e.g., stock price, strike price, volatility, time to maturity, interest rates, and dividend yields) impact option prices using the **Black-Scholes model**.

## ðŸ“‹ Features

-  **Black-Scholes Formula**: Calculates prices for European call and put options.
-  **Binary Options**: Implements binary call and put options for analysis.
-  **3D Surface Plots**: Visualizes option price dynamics with respect to stock price and time to maturity.
-  **Custom DataFrames**: Provides organized outputs for different parameters and their effects on option prices.
-  **Stylized Visualizations**: Uses `matplotlib` for 3D plots with customizable angles and color schemes.
-  **Value and Payoff Analysis**: Explores the relationship between option value and payoff upon exercise, based on varying parameters like stock price, strike price, and time to maturity.
